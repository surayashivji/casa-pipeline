# Phase 0: Environment Setup & Architecture Validation - COMPLETE âœ…

## Summary
Phase 0 has been successfully completed! The development environment is fully set up and ready for Phase 1 (GUI development with mock data).

## What Was Accomplished

### âœ… Project Structure
- Created main project directory with proper organization
- Set up `frontend/`, `backend/`, `docker/`, and `docs/` directories
- Initialized Git repository with comprehensive `.gitignore`

### âœ… Frontend Setup (React + Vite)
- Created React application using Vite for fast development
- Installed all required dependencies:
  - Three.js ecosystem for 3D rendering
  - React Router for navigation
  - TanStack Query for data fetching
  - Zustand for state management
  - Tailwind CSS for styling
  - Headless UI and Heroicons for components
  - Recharts for data visualization
  - Socket.io for real-time updates
- Configured Tailwind CSS with PostCSS
- Set up environment variables

### âœ… Backend Setup (FastAPI)
- Created Python virtual environment
- Installed all required dependencies:
  - FastAPI with Uvicorn
  - SQLAlchemy for database ORM
  - PostgreSQL driver (psycopg2)
  - Alembic for database migrations
  - Pydantic for data validation
  - Playwright for web scraping
  - RMBG for background removal
  - Trimesh for 3D model processing
  - Redis and Celery for task queues
  - AWS SDK for cloud storage
- Created modular project structure:
  - `app/api/` - API routes
  - `app/core/` - Configuration and database
  - `app/models/` - Database models
  - `app/schemas/` - Pydantic schemas
  - `app/scrapers/` - Web scraping modules
  - `app/services/` - Business logic
  - `app/workers/` - Background tasks

### âœ… Database & Infrastructure
- Configured Docker Compose for PostgreSQL and Redis
- Set up Adminer for database management
- Created comprehensive database schema
- Configured connection pooling and health checks

### âœ… Development Tools
- Created root `package.json` with convenient scripts
- Set up environment variable management
- Created API contract documentation
- Configured CORS for frontend-backend communication

### âœ… Verification
- All components tested and verified working
- Backend imports successfully
- Frontend builds without errors
- Environment files properly configured
- Project structure complete

## Available Commands

### Development
```bash
# Start everything (database + backend + frontend)
npm run dev

# Start individual services
npm run dev:frontend    # React app on :5173
npm run dev:backend     # FastAPI on :8000
npm run dev:db          # PostgreSQL + Redis

# Database management
npm run db:start        # Start database services
npm run db:stop         # Stop database services
npm run db:reset        # Reset database (removes data)
```

### Installation
```bash
# Install all dependencies
npm run install:all
```

## Access Points
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8000
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:8000/docs
- **Database Admin**: http://localhost:8080 (when Docker is running)

## Next Steps
Phase 0 is complete! You're now ready to proceed with:

**Phase 1: Build Complete GUI with Mock Data**
- Create React interface with both Single and Batch modes
- Implement all UI components with mock data
- Build 3D model viewer with Three.js
- Create real-time progress tracking

## Notes
- Docker is configured but not required for Phase 1 development
- All backend functionality will use mock data initially
- Database will be connected in Phase 4
- Real scraping will begin in Phase 3

The foundation is solid and ready for rapid GUI development! ðŸš€
